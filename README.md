## Known Issues

### API Rate Limit
This project uses the Hugging Face Inference API, which has rate limits for free users. If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior, it may be due to exceeding the API limit.

To resolve this:
- Consider upgrading to a paid Hugging Face plan to increase API call limits.
- Use smaller payloads or optimize the usage to stay within free-tier limits.

You can monitor API usage in your Hugging Face account.
